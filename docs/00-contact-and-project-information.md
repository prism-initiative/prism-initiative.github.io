## Getting Involved

Organizations interested in learning more about PRISM implementation, participating in the collaborative network, or evaluating the system for their populations should reach out via email. We're particularly interested in connecting with:

- Insurance companies seeking to improve early disease detection
- Healthcare researchers interested in validation studies
- Technical teams working on healthcare AI applications
- Medical professionals interested in pattern recognition insights

## Open Collaboration

PRISM operates under an open collaboration model where the codebase is publicly available while model weights require licensing agreements. Organizations implementing PRISM contribute trained models and technical improvements back to the collective, creating exponentially improving pattern recognition capabilities for all participants.

## Public Benefit Mission

PRISM operates as a Public Benefit Corporation with the legally enshrined mission of improving patient health outcomes through early detection of medical conditions. This structure ensures that patient benefit remains the primary objective regardless of ownership changes or market pressures.
