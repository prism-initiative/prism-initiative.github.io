## Foundation & Data Architecture

### [PRISM Data Format](/10-prism-data-format)

Detailed specification of PRISM's eight-field data structure that transforms medical billing records into pattern recognition input. Explains POOL, PATIENT, ASL, and the Five Ws (WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY), why markdown tables are used, and how the format enables pure sequence completion. Essential reading for anyone implementing PRISM or preparing data for processing.

### [Completely Anonymous Data Only](/11-completely-anonymous-data)

Explains PRISM's privacy-by-architecture approach using truly anonymous data rather than de-identified records. Covers the critical distinction between anonymization and de-identification, why MD5 hashing is used for verification, how complete anonymity enables better pattern recognition, computational efficiency benefits, and legal advantages. Crucial for understanding PRISM's privacy guarantees and regulatory positioning.

### [Insurance Company Unique Vantage Point](/12-insurance-vantage-point)

Explains why insurance companies are uniquely positioned to enable PRISM's pattern recognition capabilities. Covers cross-provider visibility, longitudinal patient journeys, healthcare delivery fragmentation, claims data completeness, and why hospitals or health systems can't replicate this comprehensive view. Important for stakeholders evaluating why PRISM partners with insurance companies rather than other healthcare entities.

### [Standardized and Finite Codesets](/13-standardized-codesets)

Comprehensive explanation of the medical coding systems PRISM leverages: ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, CPT, NDC, HCPCS, CMS place of service codes, and NUCC provider taxonomy.

## AI Architecture & Philosophy

### [Pure Sequence Completion Without Complexity](/20-pure-sequence-completion)

Explains PRISM's radical simplification approach: models trained exclusively to continue medical billing sequences without chat, reasoning, or complex prompting. Covers supervised fine-tuning as continued pre-training, intentional destruction of general capabilities, training to exhaustion on medical sequences, condition-specific nudges through BCO (Binary Classification Objective), and why simplicity works better than sophisticated AI techniques.

### [Retrospective-Prospective Validation](/22-retrospective-prospective)

Describes PRISM's unique validation approach achieving perfect equivalence between retrospective and prospective analysis through truncation methodology.

Important for understanding PRISM's evidence base without requiring years of prospective studies.

### ["All Models are Wrong" Philosophy](/23-all-models-wrong)

Explores PRISM's embrace of statistician George Box's insight that "all models are wrong, but some are useful." Explains why being wrong 99% of the time can represent extraordinary success when the 1% of correct suggestions prevent serious complications, how this aligns with medical investigation reality, the value of rare disease detection, and the statistical framework supporting low positive predictive values. Essential for understanding PRISM's success metrics and philosophical foundation.

### [Constructive-Only Architecture](/24-constructive-only)

Explains how PRISM's architecture prevents care denial or restriction by design.

### [BAD Example: Delayed Diagnosis of Primary Aldosteronism](/32-bad-example)

Synthetic case illustrating the tragedy of delayed diagnosis where warning signs persist for years before complications force investigation.

Highlights the missed opportunities PRISM aims to prevent.

### [NOPE Example: Sleep Apnea Presenting as Resistant Hypertension](/33-nope-example)

Synthetic case demonstrating differential diagnosis where resistant hypertension patterns lead to appropriate testing that reveals an alternative condition (sleep apnea) rather than primary aldosteronism.
