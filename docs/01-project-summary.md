# PRISM: Predictive Recommendations for Improved Screening in Medicine

## Overview

PRISM is an innovative healthcare project that works similarly to how credit card companies detect unusual patterns in purchasing behavior – but instead of flagging potential fraud, it identifies opportunities for beneficial health screenings. Using generative AI technology, the system analyzes patterns in medical billing data to recognize sequences that might suggest a need for preventive screening tests.

## How It Works

1. **Data Analysis**: PRISM analyzes only the billing data that insurance companies already have (doctor visits, lab tests, and procedures) – not electronic health records or other medical data – to identify patterns that might indicate a need for specific health screenings.

2. **Background Processing**: Operating entirely behind the scenes, PRISM processes anonymous billing data to identify patterns that might suggest beneficial screening opportunities.

3. **Physician Communication**: When the system identifies a potential screening opportunity, this information is communicated only to the patient's primary care physician through existing secure channels. PCPs receive these suggestions because they know their patients' complete medical context and can best evaluate whether additional screening would be beneficial.

4. **Privacy Protection**: The system works entirely within each insurance company's existing secure infrastructure. Patient data never leaves the insurance company's system, and all analysis is done on anonymous information.

## Key Benefits

- **Earlier Detection**: Helps identify potential health issues before they become serious
- **Better Outcomes**: Early treatment is often more effective and less invasive
- **Cost Reduction**: Early intervention typically costs significantly less than treating advanced conditions
- **Healthcare Equity**: Helps ensure consistent screening opportunities across different populations

## System Focus

PRISM focuses on identifying conditions where:
- Early detection is possible through standard screening tests
- Early intervention leads to significantly better outcomes
- Treatment costs are substantially lower with early detection
- Clear treatment paths exist for early intervention

## Safeguards and Ethics

- Medical ethics board oversight
- Focus on suggesting additional care options only (never restricting care)
- System design fundamentally prevents use for coverage denial or reduction
- Open-source approach for transparency
- Multiple layers of validation before making suggestions
- Strict privacy protections

## Partnership Structure

PRISM is developed through a strategic partnership between three key entities:
- An insurance carrier (providing secure infrastructure and data)
- A medical university (ensuring medical and ethical oversight)
- An implementing organization (delivering technical expertise and implementation support)

## Impact

By identifying opportunities for early screening, PRISM aims to:
- Support more proactive healthcare delivery
- Improve patient health outcomes
- Reduce healthcare costs through prevention
- Address healthcare disparities

PRISM represents a careful balance of innovative technology and medical expertise, operating seamlessly in the background of existing healthcare systems while maintaining strict privacy standards.
