# Cluster Architecture Approach

## Server Rack Design

PRISM's physical architecture embodies a philosophy of simplicity through modularity, deploying standardized server racks that transform consumer hardware into enterprise-capable AI infrastructure. Each rack houses multiple compact enclosures containing the GPU clusters that power PRISM's ensemble models, along with a dedicated management and training server that orchestrates the entire operation. This design reflects years of experience building resilient systems for regulated industries, where reliability matters more than cutting-edge specifications.

The standardization of rack design enables predictable scaling. When an insurance company needs additional processing capacity to handle growing patient populations or faster evaluation cycles, they simply add another identical rack. There's no complex capacity planning, no architectural redesign, no integration challenges just linear scaling through replication. Each rack operates as a semi-autonomous unit, processing its assigned workload while coordinating with other racks through the central management infrastructure.

At the heart of each rack sits the management server, a more powerful system responsible for orchestrating the ensemble, training daily model updates, and generating the natural language explanations that accompany screening suggestions. This server handles all the complex coordination tasks that keep the distributed cluster functioning smoothly. It assigns patient evaluations to specific nodes, collects and aggregates predictions, manages the continuous model retraining cycle, and generates physician-friendly explanations using specialized medical language models. While the inference nodes focus purely on pattern recognition, this management server handles everything else that makes PRISM operationally viable.

The rack design prioritizes operational simplicity over theoretical optimization. Standard server racks that any data center can accommodate. Standard power requirements that don't need special provisioning. Standard cooling approaches that work with existing HVAC systems. Standard network connections that integrate with existing infrastructure. This mundane standardization might seem unremarkable, but it's precisely what enables PRISM to deploy quickly into existing insurance company data centers without requiring specialized facilities or extensive modifications.

## Consumer GPU Strategy

The decision to build PRISM's inference infrastructure on consumer-grade graphics cards rather than enterprise GPUs represents a calculated trade-off that prioritizes cost-effectiveness and replaceability over raw performance. Each consumer GPU in the cluster handles exactly one model from the ensemble, processing patient histories through that single model repeatedly throughout the day. This focused workload doesn't require the massive memory or computational power of enterprise cards designed for training large models or serving thousands of concurrent users.

The economics of this approach prove compelling. Consumer GPUs cost a fraction of their enterprise counterparts while providing sufficient capability for PRISM's specific inference workload. When a card fails—and hardware always fails eventually—replacement involves ordering a standard part available from numerous suppliers rather than procuring specialized enterprise equipment with long lead times. This commodity hardware approach transforms GPU procurement from a strategic challenge into a routine operational task.

Performance targets guide hardware selection without overspecification. Each node needs to evaluate patient histories quickly enough to process approximately one million patients annually, translating to roughly 30 seconds per evaluation when accounting for operational overhead and maintenance windows. Consumer GPUs easily meet these requirements when running single models optimized for inference. The bottleneck in healthcare pattern recognition isn't computational power it's the availability of quality training data and the accuracy of pattern recognition, both of which PRISM addresses through its ensemble architecture rather than raw hardware performance.

The consumer GPU strategy also provides flexibility as technology evolves. When new GPU generations offer better performance per dollar, PRISM can gradually refresh its hardware through normal replacement cycles. There's no vendor lock-in, no proprietary dependencies, no architectural constraints tied to specific hardware platforms. The system runs on whatever consumer GPUs provide the best value at any given time, adapting to market conditions and technological advancement without architectural changes.

## Modular Enclosures

Within each server rack, self-contained enclosures house clusters of GPUs with their integrated cooling and power distribution systems. These modular units, typically containing four to six GPUs each, transform a collection of consumer hardware into manageable, serviceable infrastructure. Each enclosure operates as an independent unit that can be removed, serviced, or replaced without affecting other enclosures in the rack.

The modular design addresses the practical realities of maintaining distributed GPU clusters. When a power supply fails in one enclosure, technicians can swap the entire unit in minutes rather than troubleshooting individual components. When GPUs need replacement or upgrade, entire enclosures can be refreshed during scheduled maintenance windows. When cooling systems require service, affected enclosures can be temporarily removed while others continue operating. This modularity transforms complex hardware maintenance into simple replacement procedures that don't require specialized expertise.

These enclosures also provide natural failure isolation. Problems in one enclosure—whether overheating, power fluctuations, or hardware failures—remain contained rather than cascading through the entire rack. Each enclosure has its own cooling fans, its own power distribution, its own network connections. This isolation ensures that hardware problems create degraded performance rather than system failures, maintaining PRISM's availability even during component failures.

The standardization of enclosures enables operational flexibility that custom-built systems cannot match. Spare enclosures can be pre-configured and stored on-site, ready for immediate deployment when failures occur. Different GPU configurations can be tested by swapping enclosures rather than rebuilding systems. Capacity can be adjusted by adding or removing enclosures based on workload requirements. This flexibility proves invaluable in production environments where uptime matters more than optimal configuration.

## Network Isolation

PRISM's network architecture enforces strict isolation between AI inference nodes and both the insurance company's systems and the broader internet. Each GPU node connects only to PRISM's management server through dedicated network switches that create an isolated inference environment. This isolation isn't just a security measure it's a fundamental architectural principle that simplifies operations while eliminating entire categories of security concerns.

The inference nodes exist in their own network universe, unaware of anything beyond their connection to the management server. They cannot access insurance company data directly, cannot communicate with external systems, cannot download updates or patches independently. This isolation makes them immune to many common security threats. There's no attack surface for external threats, no possibility of data exfiltration, no risk of unauthorized access. The nodes simply receive patient histories from the management server, process them through their assigned models, and return predictions.

While inference nodes remain completely isolated, the management server maintains carefully controlled external connections necessary for operation. It requires secure remote access for PRISM's engineering team to perform administration and maintenance. It needs the ability to upload newly trained models to and download merged models from secure cloud repositories where the collective intelligence of all PRISM implementations accumulates. These connections are implemented through encrypted channels with strict authentication requirements, audit logging, and continuous monitoring.

The network isolation architecture also simplifies compliance and auditing. The insurance company can easily demonstrate that PRISM's AI infrastructure cannot access sensitive systems or data beyond what's explicitly provided. Network logs clearly show the limited communication pathways. Security audits can focus on the few controlled connection points rather than complex distributed systems. This architectural simplicity translates directly to operational confidence.

## Graceful Degradation

PRISM's distributed architecture naturally supports graceful degradation when components fail or fall behind, maintaining service availability even as individual nodes experience problems. When a GPU node stops responding or falls below performance thresholds, the management server automatically redistributes its workload among healthy nodes. The system continues processing patient evaluations with slightly reduced throughput rather than failing entirely.

This resilience emerges from the flexible model deployment architecture. All models reside on the management server and load into GPU memory on demand. When nodes fail, the management server automatically redistributes their assigned models to healthy nodes. A GPU that finishes its primary model's workload can swap in a different model to cover gaps left by failed hardware. The system maintains complete ensemble participation—all one hundred models still contribute votes—just with dynamic assignment across available hardware. This flexibility even enables heterogeneous deployments where GPUs of different performance levels contribute proportionally to overall throughput.

Degradation occurs smoothly at any scale. The management server tracks which models have completed processing for each patient batch and automatically schedules any missing evaluations on available hardware. A batch isn't complete until all one hundred models have provided their votes. This might mean some nodes process multiple models sequentially, trading time for completeness. In the extreme case, the entire ensemble could theoretically run on a single GPU—it would just require loading each model sequentially, extending processing time proportionally.

The management server continuously monitors system health and automatically adapts to changing conditions. It tracks inference times for each node, identifies performance degradation before complete failure, and proactively redistributes model assignments from struggling nodes. When new patient batches begin processing, it can identify any missing votes from previous batches due to errors or disruptions and schedule those specific model evaluations for completion. This dynamic adaptation ensures complete ensemble participation even with reduced hardware availability.

This fault tolerance comes without the expensive overhead typical of critical systems. PRISM doesn't require uninterruptible power supplies, redundant hardware, or complex failover mechanisms. If the entire cluster loses power unexpectedly, the only consequence is a delay in producing new screening suggestions—healthcare continues normally, just without PRISM's pattern recognition assistance that day. When power returns, the system resumes processing from where it stopped. This non-critical nature eliminates costly infrastructure requirements while maintaining practical reliability through simple resilience rather than complex redundancy.

## Linear Scaling Properties

PRISM's cluster architecture delivers perfectly linear scaling characteristics. Double the hardware deployment, double the daily patient evaluation capacity. This linear relationship holds from initial deployments processing thousands of patients daily to large installations handling tens of thousands. No architectural changes, no redesign, no diminishing returns—just predictable, proportional scaling.

This linearity emerges from the embarrassingly parallel nature of patient evaluation. Each patient's history can be processed independently without coordination between evaluations. The management server distributes patient batches across available nodes, collects results, and aggregates predictions. Whether coordinating a small or large deployment, the fundamental operation remains identical—only the volume changes.

The predictability of linear scaling transforms capacity planning from complex modeling to simple arithmetic. Processing requirements scale directly with patient population and evaluation frequency. Need to double evaluation capacity? Double the hardware. Want quarterly instead of annual evaluation cycles? Quadruple the infrastructure. This simplicity enables confident planning as implementations grow.

Linear scaling also provides investment protection. Early deployments aren't throwaway prototypes that need replacement as volume increases. Initial hardware remains just as valuable and functional as subsequent additions. Pilot programs can start small, prove value through initial deployments, then scale confidently knowing that additional investment translates directly to additional capability. This predictable growth path reduces risk and enables gradual expansion as confidence builds.
