# PRISM: Predictive Recommendations for Improved Screening in Medicine

## Call for Medical Condition Submissions

PRISM is an innovative research project developed through a strategic partnership between [Insurance Company Name], [Consulting Company Name], and [University Name]. Our collaborative initiative aims to leverage artificial intelligence to enhance preventive care through early detection. Our goal is to analyze anonymous medical billing data to identify patterns that might suggest when specific screening tests should be recommended to primary care physicians for consideration.

We're seeking input from medical professionals and other knowledgeable individuals to identify conditions that meet specific criteria for our initial validation phase. Our focus is on conditions where early detection and treatment can significantly improve patient outcomes while reducing overall healthcare costs.

### Project Philosophy
We believe that artificial intelligence should augment, not replace, medical decision-making. PRISM will serve as a supportive tool for physicians, offering suggestions for consideration rather than direct recommendations to patients. By analyzing vast amounts of billing data, we hope to identify subtle patterns that might otherwise be overlooked, potentially leading to earlier detection of serious conditions.

### Required Criteria for Conditions
To be suitable for our initial validation phase, conditions must meet all of the following criteria:

1. Early detection must be possible through a standard screening test that could be reasonably added to a routine physical or yearly workup if the physician agrees it's warranted.
2. The condition must have a clear treatment path that, when implemented early, offers significantly better outcomes compared to later intervention.
3. Early treatment must be substantially less invasive, less expensive, or more effective than treatment of the advanced condition.
4. The treatment (either early or late) should provide definitive resolution or significant improvement for the patient.
5. The condition should have distinct billing codes for:
   - The diagnostic screening test
   - The early-stage treatment
   - The late-stage treatment

### What We Need from You
If you're aware of a condition that meets these criteria, please provide:

- The name and brief description of the condition
- The relevant diagnostic test(s)
- The typical early and late treatment approaches
- The associated billing codes (if known, optional)
- Any additional context you believe would be helpful (optional)

While our primary audience is medical professionals, we welcome submissions from anyone with relevant knowledge or experience, provided the suggested condition meets our criteria.

### Impact
Your input could help shape a system that:

- Supports physicians in delivering proactive care
- Improves patient outcomes through earlier intervention
- Reduces healthcare costs through prevention
- Helps address healthcare disparities through standardized screening suggestions
