# PRISM: Predictive Recommendations for Improved Screening in Medicine

PRISM is a breakthrough approach to preventive healthcare that leverages artificial intelligence to identify opportunities for beneficial health screenings. By analyzing patterns in medical billing data, PRISM helps healthcare providers recognize when patients might benefit from specific screening tests, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.
