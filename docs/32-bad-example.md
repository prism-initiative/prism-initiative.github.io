# PRISM BAD Example: Delayed Diagnosis of Primary Aldosteronism

This synthetic case represents a BAD example for primary aldosteronism screening - a patient whose early symptoms were treated empirically with escalating medications for several years, resulting in the development of serious complications before the underlying condition was finally diagnosed. This delayed recognition led to permanent organ damage and much more complex ongoing management.

## Clinical Narrative

A 58-year-old male construction supervisor in Ohio whose hypertension was initially treated as essential hypertension with standard medication escalation protocols. Despite early signs that might have suggested secondary hypertension (medication resistance, low-normal potassium), the focus remained on adding more blood pressure medications rather than investigating underlying causes. Over three years, he developed increasingly severe hypertensive episodes requiring emergency care, eventual heart failure, and chronic kidney disease before primary aldosteronism was finally diagnosed. By then, the complications had become permanent, requiring ongoing complex medical management that could have been prevented with earlier recognition.

## Key Pattern Recognition Elements

**What makes this a tragic BAD example:**

1. **Missed Early Opportunities**: Early signs of secondary hypertension (medication resistance, low potassium, muscle cramps) were present as early as 2020-2021 but were not investigated. Instead, medications were continually escalated.

2. **Emergency Department Visits**: Multiple ER visits for severe headaches and hypertensive episodes represented missed opportunities for comprehensive secondary hypertension evaluation.

3. **Development of Irreversible Complications**: By the time testing was finally ordered in 2022, the patient had already developed heart failure and chronic kidney disease - permanent complications that early diagnosis could have prevented.

4. **Complex Long-term Management**: The delayed diagnosis resulted in the need for multiple specialists (cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology), multiple medications, and ongoing management of complications rather than the simple single-medication management seen in early detection cases.

5. **Late Testing Trigger**: Aldosterone/renin testing was finally ordered only after complications developed, representing a reactive rather than proactive approach to secondary hypertension evaluation.

6. **Higher Treatment Requirements**: The patient required high-dose spironolactone (100mg vs 25-50mg in early cases) plus continued management of heart failure and kidney disease.

**Contrast with Early Detection**: This case demonstrates exactly what PRISM aims to prevent - the progression from treatable early disease to permanent complications requiring lifelong complex medical management.

**Teaching Value**: This case provides PRISM with a clear example of the consequences of delayed pattern recognition. The system learns that certain early patterns (resistant hypertension + low potassium + symptoms) should trigger immediate investigation rather than empirical medication escalation, helping it recognize similar situations before complications develop.

The billing pattern shows the dramatic difference in healthcare utilization between early and late diagnosis - from simple outpatient management to emergency visits, hospitalizations, and multiple specialist involvement.
