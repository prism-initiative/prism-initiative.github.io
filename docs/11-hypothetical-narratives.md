# PRISM: Hypothetical Narratives of Suggestions in Practice

## Case 1: Susan's Journey with Hypothyroidism

Susan, a 43-year-old marketing executive, had been seeing different doctors over the course of two years. She first visited her primary care physician complaining of persistent fatigue, which was attributed to her demanding work schedule and stress. When she developed mild depression several months later, she was referred to a psychiatrist who prescribed an antidepressant. Over the next year, she saw a dermatologist for dry skin and hair loss, and later visited her primary care doctor again for weight gain despite no significant changes in diet or exercise.

Each specialist treated the symptoms they saw, and her primary care physician, who only saw her occasionally, didn't have the full picture of how these seemingly unrelated issues were progressing. The symptoms appeared gradually and were common enough that no single doctor recognized the pattern.

PRISM, analyzing Susan's billing history, detected a pattern in her multiple specialist visits and symptoms that matched common presentations of hypothyroidism. The system generated a suggestion to her primary care physician to consider a thyroid panel. The simple blood test revealed moderate hypothyroidism, and Susan started on thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Within three months, her energy levels improved, her depression lifted, and her other symptoms began to resolve. What could have continued as years of scattered treatments for individual symptoms was addressed with one targeted intervention.

## Case 2: Michael's Early Detection of Primary Aldosteronism

Michael, a 52-year-old teacher, had been treated for high blood pressure by his primary care physician for three years. Despite trying three different blood pressure medications, his readings remained stubbornly elevated. He occasionally mentioned muscle cramps to his doctor and had been to urgent care twice for severe headaches. His doctor adjusted his medications and recommended reducing salt intake, a common approach for resistant hypertension.

During a particularly bad bout of headaches, Michael saw a neurologist, who ordered an MRI to rule out serious conditions but found nothing concerning. He was prescribed migraine medication and referred back to his primary care physician for blood pressure management.

PRISM identified a pattern in Michael's medical billing history: resistant hypertension, recurring headaches, and periodic episodes of muscle cramping - all potential indicators of Primary Aldosteronism. When his doctor received the suggestion to consider an aldosterone-to-renin ratio test, they realized they hadn't considered this relatively common but underdiagnosed cause of resistant hypertension.

The test confirmed Primary Aldosteronism, and Michael was started on a targeted medication that specifically blocks excess aldosterone. His blood pressure normalized within weeks on just this single medication, and his headaches and muscle cramps resolved. Without this intervention, his uncontrolled blood pressure would likely have continued damaging his cardiovascular system over time.

## Case 3: Lisa's Critical Iron Deficiency Diagnosis

Lisa, a 35-year-old nurse, had a complex medical history that made it challenging to pinpoint the cause of her gradually worsening fatigue. She had been diagnosed with anxiety five years earlier and saw a therapist regularly. She also had occasional gastrointestinal issues, for which she periodically consulted a gastroenterologist who had diagnosed her with irritable bowel syndrome.

When Lisa developed fatigue, she initially attributed it to her night shifts at the hospital and mentioned it during her therapy sessions. Her therapist suggested it might be related to her anxiety and recommended stress-reduction techniques. During her annual physical, she mentioned the fatigue to her primary care doctor, who noted that her blood pressure was slightly low but not concerning.

Over six months, Lisa developed shortness of breath when climbing stairs. She saw a pulmonologist, who ordered basic breathing tests but found nothing significant. The pulmonologist suggested it might be exercise-induced asthma and prescribed an inhaler.

PRISM, analyzing the pattern of Lisa's various symptoms and doctor visits, flagged a pattern consistent with iron-deficiency anemia and suggested a complete blood count test to her primary care physician. The test revealed significant iron-deficiency anemia. Further investigation by her gastroenterologist discovered small but chronic gastrointestinal bleeding that was causing the iron deficiency.

With iron supplementation and treatment of the underlying bleeding, Lisa's energy returned to normal within two months. Her shortness of breath resolved completely, and she was able to return to her regular activities. What could have progressed to severe anemia requiring hospitalization and blood transfusions was corrected with early intervention and targeted treatment.
