# PRISM NOPE Example: Sleep Apnea Presenting as Resistant Hypertension

This synthetic case represents a NOPE example for primary aldosteronism screening - a patient whose resistant hypertension and fatigue symptoms reasonably prompted aldosterone/renin testing, but whose underlying condition was obstructive sleep apnea rather than primary aldosteronism.

## Clinical Narrative

A 49-year-old male accountant in Texas who developed gradually worsening hypertension despite treatment escalation. His presentation included classic features that could suggest secondary hypertension: treatment resistance, fatigue, and the need for multiple medications. When his primary care physician ordered a comprehensive secondary hypertension workup including aldosterone and renin testing, this represented appropriate clinical decision-making given his presentation. However, the concurrent sleep study revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea as the underlying cause of his resistant hypertension.

## Key Pattern Recognition Elements

**What makes this a valid NOPE example:**

1. **Reasonable Clinical Suspicion**: The progression from single-agent to triple-agent therapy with persistent symptoms (fatigue, headaches) provided legitimate reasons to consider secondary hypertension including primary aldosteronism.

2. **Appropriate Timing**: The aldosterone/renin testing occurred during the peak clinical concern when symptoms were worsening and medication requirements were escalating.

3. **Concurrent Alternative Discovery**: The sleep study was ordered around the same time as the hormonal workup, representing a comprehensive approach to secondary hypertension evaluation.

4. **Clear Resolution Pattern**: CPAP therapy led to meaningful improvement in blood pressure control, demonstrating that sleep apnea was indeed the underlying driver of the resistant hypertension.

5. **Medication De-escalation**: The reduction from triple therapy back to single-agent control provides strong evidence that the alternative diagnosis explained the clinical picture.

**Teaching Value**: This case helps PRISM learn that patterns suggesting primary aldosteronism (resistant hypertension, escalating medications, fatigue) can have alternative explanations. The key distinguishing feature may be the temporal relationship between alternative diagnosis and clinical improvement, rather than the initial presenting pattern itself.
